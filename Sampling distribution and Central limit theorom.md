### Sampling distribution and Central limit theorom

what is sampling distribution??
Distribution of a sample

What is a sample?
subset of the population

what is population?
The entire dataset what we have at hand


lets take income of people in chennai:

So we take lets say 30 samples from our population with each sample containing 30 observations, so for each sample (s) i calculate the mean and st deviation and plot a distribution using that mean and std deviation which I calculated from the samples. This distribution is called sampling distribution


### CENTRAL LIMIT THEOROM

CLT says that given any distribution with mean and variance. If I sample (n) samples from it with each containing (m) observations in it. If I calculate the mean of all samples and plot the distribution (z) with it

I say (z) will be normally distributed with mean (mu same as population mean) and variance (sigmasquare/m) as m approaches infinity


Power of this is having to sample only a finite number of data, We can estimate the mean and variance for whole population

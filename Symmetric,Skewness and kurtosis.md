## Symmetric distribution, Skewness and Kurtosis

1.symmetric distribution is a one which is a mirror image of itself on the each of the side ex. our normal distribution is a symmetric dist

2. Skewness - Every distribution has a peak and a tail. peak is the mean value of the distribution or where the most of the data lies and it has tails on both the sides which is pretty small in normal dist but there are distribution which has a longer and fatter tail on either side. The length of the tail on either side of the distribution is called the skewness of the distribution

1. postively skewed: If the distribution has tail on the postive x direction then its called positive skew
2. negative skewed: If the distribution has tail on the left side of the mean then we can call it negative skew

ex. log normal distribution have skewness in them

3. kurtosis- how sharp is our peak is the kurtosis factor. kurtosis of a normal distribution is 0 which is taken as defacto standard to measure the kurtosis of other random distributions

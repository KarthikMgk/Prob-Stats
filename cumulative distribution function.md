### Cumulative distribution function

Cumulative distribution function looks like as follows:

similar to normal dist this also has mean, std dev and variance
mean is the the most common value found in the any population
variance is the  sum of square of the difference between each observation and the computed mean and standard deviation is the square root of the variance

As the variance increases the thickness or broadness of the pdf and cdf increases and vice versa

As seen in the image above, lower the variance less spread the curve. So variance is often called the spread of the distribution and standard deviation is mostly used to segregate the values into groups

Coming back to Cumulative distribution function.

CDF lies in the range of 0 to 1 and it often calculated by taking the cumulative sum of pdf at each and every point of the graph.

At any point x, CDF gives what percent of y component lies within the current x values which is denoted in percentages
example, 50% of y lies within x<=2 (just an example)

### standard normal variate

This the method of standardising any given random distribution to a normal distribution because if we convert them to normal we can use also our knowledge of ND on them insteading of calculating from scratch

How do we do??

For a given (x) continuos rv, we calculate the mean and std dev of it and perform (x-mean/sigma) for all x in the list of observation such that if we have 50 observation of x by standardising it we have a new list of 50 obs, And these obs are called standard normal variate(Zi)

After we standardise it, we can plot its pdf,cdf and apply 68-95-99.7 rules and take out all information
